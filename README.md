## Hi there :octocat: I'm Mbaye SENE👋

I'm a passionate web developer 🧑‍💻 and a Cloud technology enthusiast from Dakar 🇸🇳 . I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source lover. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
